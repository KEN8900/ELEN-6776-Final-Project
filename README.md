# ELEN-6776-Final-Project

This repository is for the Final Project of Columbia University Course ELEN 6776 by Hongkuan Yu and Yelin Mao. ELEN 6776 is a course about Content Storage and Distribution.



In this final project, we implemented multi-threading data control between the database and the MQTT broker. The main program achieves multi-threading read and write operations using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) (C++) and is connected to an MQTT broker ([Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) to test and simulate the results.



More are in progress.
